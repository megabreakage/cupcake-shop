        <h1>Cupcakes</h1>
      </div>
        <p>A cupcake (also British English: fairy cake; Hiberno English: bun; Australian
          English: fairy cake or patty cake) is a small cake designed to serve one
          person, which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup. As with
          larger cakes, icing and other cake decorations, such as candy, may be applied.</p>

        <h2>Examples of Cupcakes</h2>

        <h4>Chocolate Chip Cheesecakes</h4>
        <img class="best" src="pics/cheese-cake.png">
        <p>These are a simple cheesecake batter baked in a standard muffin pan, and no
          waterbath or other special equipment is required. The pans are lined with muffin
          wrappers, which make them easy to remove after baking, and a graham cracker crumb
          mixture is pressed into each one.
          The crust bakes along with the cheesecake. The cheesecake batter is a thick, creamy
          mixture of cream cheese and a bit of sour cream (or greek yogurt will also work) and it
          bakes up to have a rich, creamy texture. Chocolate chips are added on top of the
          crust before the batter is added to each of the muffin cups and are also sprinkled
          on top of each cheesecake before baking.</p>

        <h4>Cinnamon Roll</h4>
        <img class="best" src="pics/cinnamon-roll.png">
        <p>These cupcakes are packed full of cinnamon and brown sugar, with two layers of
          cinnamon-swirl inside and topped with a generous helping of streusel. The aroma
          as they bake is phenomenal and your entire kitchen will be filled with the scent
          of cinnamon.  After they cool for just a few minutes they of course need a little
          drizzle of a vanilla glaze icing on top, because you simply cannot eat a cinnamon
          roll unless it is slath</p>

          They may be tiny, but poppy seeds are packed with a subtle, nutty, peppery flavour
          that goes perfectly with the zesty lemon sponge.</p>
